**Presenting Caroline's submission for the 2025 YETI Challenge: Vol-E the general-purpose robot!**

For an explanation of the project, start with the website: https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/vol-e/home 

-------------------------

To find the code you are looking for, here is a guide to the directories in this repository:
- **YETI_puzzle** --> solution to first part of the YETI (namely, unscrambling and translating the transmission)
- **vol-e** --> Arduino code for the current version of Vol-E
- **upgraded_demo** --> proof of concept for one application of Vol-E, as Popsicle 2.0 (see website for explanation); includes Arduino code for upgraded Vol-E, RC receiver, and Python script to generate heat maps from Vol-E's transmitted data
